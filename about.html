        <p>Carter Grandon has been interested in programming and computers for many years. He first used Scratch when he
            was eight years old and incorporated it into many projects in late elementary school. Carter's high school
            computer class taught him about more formal programming. Now he is studying computer programming at Georgian
            College, and plans to enter a career in this area in the future.</p>
